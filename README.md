# Spy_Bot_Interface
Interface to control the virtual presence robot for Rajasthan Hackathon 3.0

#Problem Statement
Humans can interact with the environment they are present at a certain point of time.

#Our Solution
We would try to build a virtual presence robot using which a human can be virtually present anywhere having a access to internet.

We have used some basic sensors and actuators for the prototype. 
For real life application the right sensors and actuators should be chosen according to the appplication requirements.

#Applications
1. Defence : As a spy robot to reduce the risk taken by military personnel.
2. Heath : As a remote surgeon .
3. Tourism : As a virtual guide for the tourists
and  many more
